# Introduction

This project contains Ansible modules and Python3 library that can be used to automate HPE Comware 7 switches. The modules rely on NETCONF to communicate with the device for making configuration changes and getting operational data back such as LLDP neighbors, OS, serial number, uptime, and active interfaces on the device.

# Python Support
  * Python 3.7.4+
  
# Ansible Support
  * Ansible 2.10.4+

# Getting Started
To get started, see the [demo](demo/) for detailed steps.  
  
# Documentation
The [list](docs/README.md) of Ansible modules  and more detailed summary of each module can be found in [docs](docs/).  

## ansible-doc
ansible-doc is a utility that offers users built-in "man-page-like" docs for Ansible modules.  
This is a great command line utility to reference to understand the parameters each module supports.  
```
ansible-doc -M library/ comware_vlan
```
The -M flag here specifies the directory in which the modules reside.   
The following output shows the result of checking the comware_vlan module document.  
```
$ ansible-doc comware_vlan
> COMWARE_VLAN
